#volatility3
#PsScan scans memory to find processes that have been unlinked from the EPROCESS list. - When attempting to identify rogue processes with Volatility 3, what is the main advantage of windows.psscan.PsScan over windows.pslist.PsList?

#ModScan - What Volatility 3 plug-in can be used to identify unloaded kernel modules?

#volatility2
--profile - To run a Volatility 2 plugin against a memory image, which parameter is required for the tool to know what operating system to expect?

# Attacks
#code_injection
Find an unmapped PE file in a memory section that is marked as executable. - What technique can be used to identify reflective code injection on a Windows system?

#code_injection - While comparing the results of windows.dlllist.DllList and windows.ldrmodules.LdrModules output for a suspicious process, the results for windows.ldrmodules.LdrModules show additional sections of executable code. These sections do not map to an executable file on disk. What might the differences in the output of these Volatility commands indicate?

#code_injection - To execute code in a target process

#reflective_code_injection

#memory_baseliner
Memory Baseliner - An analyst examining a memory image wants to reduce as much data as possible to isolate potential anomalies compared to a known good memory image.

#page_file_or_swap_space
Memory forensics should include  RAM and page file or swap space.

Doubly linked list - Which of the following data structures is used by the Windows kernel to track multiple executive process blocks?

#eventconsumers
wmiprvse.exe - When performing forensic analysis on a system, which process should you look for to identify whether any CommandLineEventConsumers have been utilized during an incident?

#malfind - It scans process memory sections looking for indications of hidden code injection.

#Command_line - What process metadata allows you to determine whether the executable name matches the image name of the process?


-----
