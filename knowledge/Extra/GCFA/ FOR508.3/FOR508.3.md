Why Memory Forensics		
5 - 8	Memory Forensics Basic	Memory Forensics Advantages, EDR and Memory Forensics, Concepts Accelerate EDR Investigations, 
Acquiring Memory		
11 -14	Windows Memory Acquisition	Live VS Dead System, Hibernation File Analysis, VM Memory
Introduction to Memory Analysis		
16 - 19	What is Memory Analysis	What is Memory Analysis, Memory Analysis Process, Process Structure
20 - 25 	Volatility	*--info shows profiles supported ** vol.py pluginname -h (plugin help) ** 3.0 gets rid of profiles, and allow multiple sample to be analyzed at once
25 - 26	Performing Memory Analysis	Steps: Identify Rogue Processes, Analyze Process Objects, Review Network Artifacts, Look for evidence of code injection, audit drivers and rootkit detection, dump sucpicious processes and drivers.
Rogue Processes		
27 - 32	Identify Rogue Processes	EPROCESS Blocks in Memory, Rogue Process Identification
33 - 43	Identify Rogue Processes w/ Volatility	Identify Rogue processes w/ volatility, windows.pslist, Rogue processes hiding in plain site, Know Normal Find Evil (SVCHOST.EXE), windows.psscan, windows.pstree,
44 - 51	Process Analysis	Finding Webshells Via Paren't Process Anaylsis, Orphan processes, Persistence and Lateral Movement Processes, WMI and PowerShell Processes, Investigating WMI Processes (Impacket) 
52 -55	Data Reduction	Memory Baseliner, Memory Baseliner(DarkComet) 
56	Rogue Processes Overview	Pslist ** pssan ** pstree(-v =verbose info) ** malprocfind ** processbl (-B=baseline, -U=non-matches, -K=matched proceses)

Analyze Process Objects		
70	echotrail.io	OSR to determine normal ** may contain malware-specific examples ** contains summary, relationships, connection ** higher EPI score is more common
75	1) Pstree	quickly identify unusual relationships ** cannot show terminated processes as it relies on linked lists like pslist**Pic: vol.py...pstree --output=dot --output-file=pstree.dot     dot -Tping pstree.dot -o pstree.png
78	1) example processes	 
80	WMI/Powershell  attacks	WmiPrvSe is parent of WMI-based attacks ane Cmdline event consumers ** automatically investigate scrcons ((ActiveScriptEventConsumers) and children ** look into spawns of wsmprovhost (PS target)
84	Baseline	compare known good image to suspect sample. -B=baseline image, -U=not in baseline, -K=only in baseline** There's processbl, servicbl, and driverbl
87	Process review	Check file path, parent relationships, commandline arguments, and start time ** malprocfind looks for process anomalies
90	Find Process objects	DLL's, Handles (Files, Directory handles, Registry, Mutex/Semaphore, Events), Threads, Memory Sections, Sockets
92	2) Process Object Plugins	dlllist (-p) shows cmdline too ** cmdline ** getsids (user or built-in accts) ** handles (-s=supress unnamed handles, -t=type file/reg) ** mutantscan
93	2) dlllist	provides base offset, DLL size, load count, Load time (sign of DLL injection) and DLL filepath ** recommended to look at command line first then review loaded DLL's
96	2) Cobalt Strike IOCs	Sacrificial processes ** Find many exited child processes under PS and WMIPrvSE and check command line arguments ** perhaps rundll.32.exe with a internet connection or w/o .dll specified = suspicious
98	2) getsids	Only top entry is the account SID, everything below is group info that the account belongs to. ** differentiate between local admin (administrator) and domain admin ** wmoami /all shows SIDs and group info
104	2) handles	suppress unnamed handles w/ -S ** specify types -T, recommended is File, Mutant, and Registry **Filescan and mutantscan search for FILE_OBJECTS/_KMUTANT objects
107	2) Cobalt Strike - Named Pipes	Named Pipes - designed for communication (psexec, cobalt strike) ** "handles | grep -i pipe" ** cobalt-strike begins with MSSE
108	2) Mutants	Mark teritory, originally designed to avoid RACE conditions ** great IOC's, but do not stand out at first glance ** limit acces to a resource so only 1 process at a time can access
110	Process Objects review	After narrowing down to a particular process, check for command line, DLL file paths, SID and handles (file/reg)
112	3) Network Connections	80,443,880 not browser **connections to internal/external IP **web to IP vs domain **RDP to external IP **peer to peer connections **6667 IRC
114	3) Network Plugins	Connections (xp/2003) ** connscan (TCPT_OBJECT) ** sockets ** sockscan (ADDRESS_OBJECT) ** netscan (vista+) - very similar to netstat
115	3) Netscan	Identify established and terminated TCP connections ** view protocol, Local/remote IP, TCP State, PID, Process Owner, and creation time
