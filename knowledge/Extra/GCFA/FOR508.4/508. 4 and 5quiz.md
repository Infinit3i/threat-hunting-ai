# 508.4 Quiz

## log2timeline

- **Purpose of the filter file option**: Limiting the total number of files and directories log2timeline.py needs to traverse to extract the data from a device or image file.
  
- **Time zone representation**: One of the options an analyst can select when running log2timeline is a time zone. What does the time zone represent?

- **Command to obtain data**: 
  - Command: `Log2timeline.py --storage-file /path-to/plaso.dump /dev/sdd`
  - Description: What command allows a forensic analyst to use log2timeline.py to obtain data from a physical device?

- **Core areas of knowledge for Windows super timeline**: 
  - Filesystem metadata
  - Windows artifacts
  - Registry keys

- **Functionality**: log2timeline consolidates multiple forensic artifact types into one detailed timeline.

## timesketch

- **Collaboration tool**: Timesketch allows multiple investigators to collaborate across timelines in real time, all while tagging, annotating, and enriching the data.

## General Questions

- **First pivot-point in timeline investigation**: Time of the incident.

- **Plaso engine**: Plaso is the Python-based back-end engine used when creating a super timeline.

## capa

- **Functionality**: What open-source tool disassembles executables and relies on crowdsourced code patterns to determine a suspicious file's functionality?

## Lateral Movement

- **File creation and modification time**: An analyst hunting for lateral movement finds a suspicious file on a Windows system and notices the file creation time is after the file modification time. What could the creation time of the file represent?

- **YARA Rule Match**: 
  - Description: A portable executable file, 1024 KB in size, containing the strings `bpython27.dll` and `LogonUI.exe`.
  - YARA Rule:
    ```yara
    rule FOR508_TestRule {  
        meta:  
        description = "YARA rule test"  
        strings:  
        $s0 = "bpython27.dll"  
        $s1 = "LogonUI.exe"  
        condition:  
        uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and filesize < 3500KB and all of them  
    } 
    ```

- **File timestamp behavior**: The modification date always stays the same if a file is copied or moved. The creation date changes to the current time when the file is copied, but does not change when the file is moved via cut-and-paste.

## Timeline Analysis

- **Starting point**: In the timeline analysis process, where do you begin? 
  - Answer: Determine timeline scope.

- **Benefit of timeline analysis**: Too many timestamp entries are made for an attacker to effectively modify them all, making anti-forensics on Microsoft operating systems difficult for an attacker.

## Plaso

- **Command-line tool for extracting events**: 
  - Tool: Psort.py
  - Description: Which command-line tool would an analyst use to search the super timeline for the storage file that Plaso produces and extract the events from that file in chronological order?

- **Content of the plaso.dump file**: A list of all plug-ins/parsers that were run to extract the data.

- **Tool for sorting and processing Plaso storage files**: 
  - Tool: psort
  - Description: Which of the following tools in the Plaso suite allows an analyst to sort and process Plaso storage files?

## MACB Timestamps

- **Metadata changed time**: C - What MACB timestamp letter in a timeline represents the metadata changed time?



# Section 5

## UsnJrnl

$LogFile and $UsnJrnl - Which two files perform tracking of the journaling functions of NTFS?
$UsnJrnl artifacts can still be recovered. - What evidence of a deleted file often exists even after a data wiping solution has been used?
To store high-level summary information about file and directory changes - What is the purpose of the $UsnJrnl NTFS system file?

Compare the $FILE_NAME creation time to the timestamp stored in $STANDARD_INFORMATION. - Which of the following techniques can be used to identify whether timestamp backdating may have occurred on a file?

Yes. - Is it possible to recover deleted keys, values, and timestamps from the Windows Registry?
