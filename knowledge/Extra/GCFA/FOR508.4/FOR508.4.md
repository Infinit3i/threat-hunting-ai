Malware Discovery		
5	Anomaly Detection	YARA Pattern Matching ** Sigcheck  ** DensityScout - check entropy (obfuscation/packing ** Capa - Capability identification (anti-AV, injection, embedded)
7	YARA	by VT to classify malware **  string/header-based sigs**Yara64.exe tool - stand-alone can search folders/files of suspiected malware **works on all OS ** built into other tools
X.7	File Entropy	
9	DensityScout 	Windows tool, check entropy (obfuscation/packing) ** densityscout -pe -r -p 0.1 -o results.txt <directory of exe> ** WILL have false positives
X.12-13	Maldump	
12	Sigcheck	Windows tool, checks digital sigs and dumps version info **  sigcheck -c -e -h -v [dir-of-exe] > sigcheck-results.csv ** can compare to virustotal
X.8	Sigcheck Results	
14	Capa	 detection using malware patterns/actions** rules are written in YAML ** speeds up investigations by showing ATT&CK tech, behavior, capabilties** capa -f pe -v filename.exe
17	Combine All	narrow down using all tools to find anomalies ** Yara rulsets + check entropy + Signature and hash + use capa to determine capabilities** there will be false positives

intro to Super Timelines		
22	Timeline Benefits	Find anti-forensic techniques ** system activity ~ time of event ** Detect C2 channels ** challenge is differenting legit vs evil activity
25	Timeline Trinity	Filesystem metadata + Windows Artifacts + Registry Keys
26	Artifact Review	RED POSTER ** Artifacts for comumucation, downloads, execution, file interaction , deleted files, USB, SAM (users), Browsers (pg 28-42)
43	Pivot points	Look in proximity of attack time > Network (URL/Domains) > Process activity (DLL injection) >Name of File (.rar, py, ps1, .exe name) > UserAccount > Activity (Latmoves/Anti-forensics)
46	FileSystem vs SuperTimeline	FileSystem - Wider OS capability ** ONLY filesystem metadata, handles NTFS,EXT, CD-ROM // Supertimelines - filesystem, Artifact timestamps, registry timestamps
FileSystem Timelines		
50	FileSystem Timeline	Directories and Files (includes deleted/unallocated metadata) ** Modified, Access, Change, Born timess ** Any Filesystem type: NTFS, FAT,EXT,ISO,HFS+,UFS, ** timezone saves
52	Timestamp Examples	Rename = only Change ** Local move = only C ** copied = M before B ** Volume move (cut/paste) = may only have access time update
54	Timestamp Execptions	Office products & AV update Access ** Anti-forensics ** Archive SW (.zip, .rar, tgz) usually only Mod time is updated **
55	LatMove Example	net use (transferred file via share) has Mod>Born = Time of latmove**Mountpoints2 NTUser.dat shows local and remote mounted volumes
58	Create Filetimeline	1) MFTECmd to create body file ** FLS is used in linux to create body file ** 2) Sleuth Kit's Mactime converts the  bodyfile into csv to analyze/view. 
	Lab: File System Timeline	
Intro to Super Timelines		
68	LatMove Example	4626 type 3 login > Spinlock.exe B-time >  Prefetch shows run time > New file created in Sys32 folder B-time > IP found in modified reg key M-Time > file execution w/ prefetch files
70	Mal Install Example	4624/4672 Admin login > .exe file creation > 7030/7045 service creation in event logs > .exe file execution > File creation > 4634 acctLogoff
72	Log2timline	Previously written in perl, re-written in pyton ** log2timeline extracts events/image for Plaso storage file ** psort arranges the TL's ** pinfo provides metadata/stats on storage file
73	Parsers	originally Created for  Windows** WinReg (registry-specific) , Webhist (various browsers), Android, Linux and OSX parsers. ** parsers normalize different data sources to be viewable from 1 tool
80	Log2timline.py	log2timeline.py [storagefile] [Source] ** Storage file = output.dump location , Source = device, image or directory of files, -z <timezone> = original TZ of system, --help for helpfile
X.66	Log2timeline Updates	
82	Log2timeline Targets	Raw image (image.dd)**EWF image (image.E01)**Virt. Disk Image (triage.vhdx)**Physical Device (/dev/sdd)**Vol. via Partition number (--partition 2) **Triage Folder** avoid mntpoints
Targetting Super Timeline Creation		
85	Targetting Super TL's	Target via Parsers (--parsers) ** target via Filter files (-f filterfile) ** target via triage image
87	Parsers	preset less parsers ** Win7 actually includes Win7 and higher ** some plugins nest other plugins ** !parsername, to remove specific plugin, to add a plugin do not include !
88	Filter Files	specify files that are going to be parsed ** turns overnight task into a few minutes sometimes ** current format is YAML, previously .txt **log2timeline.py -f <filter_windows.yaml plaso.dump <target>
90	Triage 	 Triage folder ** artifacts to collect memory, Reg Hives, LNK Files, Jump links, prefetch, Event logs, Browser Data Browser Data, $MFT, $LogFile/$UsnJrnl, PageFile and Hiberanation File
Filtering the Super Timeline		
94	pinfo.py	Displays stats of plaso.dump file created (when tool was ran, all plugings/filter files used, counts for each artifacts and errors) ** pinfo.py -v plaso.dump
99	psort.py	turns into readable format (l2tcsv or elastic search), deduplicates data ** optional TimeSlide filter to specify times ** psort.py --output-time-zone 'UTC' -o l2tcsv -w superTL.csv plasodump
101	Practical Use (web svr)	1) log2timeline for traige image w/ specific parsers & local time 2)  add filetimeline w/ mactime parser + bodyfile &local time 3) Filter timeline w/ dates using psort  & UTC
102	practical use (f-response)	attack remote system using F-response, create a timeline using log2timeline + filter, filter using psort
	Add 83 - example	
Super Timeline Analysis		
107	Super TL Output	noisy, has 15+ columns by default, ** recommended: Date, Time, MACB, sourcetype, type, description, filename, inode, extra ** colorized w/ conditional formats
113	TL analysis process	Determine questions to answer ** Find pivot points (times or artifacts) ** Determine if Filesystem can answer, or create a Super TL ** Filter TL ** Analyze TL
	Lab: Super Timeline Analysis	
116	Scaling Timeline Analysis	yara_match.py runs against prebuilt timelines for IOC's provided ** TLs inputed into DB ( elasticsearch, elk, splunk) and for stacking ** Timesketch allows multiple analyst to collaborate
