# Malware Basics

Malware analysis is the process of analyzing a malware sample/binary and extracting as much information as possible from it. The information we extract helps us understand the scope of the functionality of the Malware, how the system was infected with the malware and how to defend against similar attacks in the future.

### Objectives of malware analysis [^1]

- Understand type of malware.
- How the system was infected with the malware. 
- Is it a targeted attack or a #phishing attack?
- How it communicates with the attacker.
- To exfiltrate useful indicators like registry entries/keys and filenames for the purpose of generating signatures that can be used to detect future detection.

### Types Of Malware Analysis

- Static analysis: Is the process of analyzing malware without executing or running it. The objective is to extract as much metadata from the malware as possible. Example: strings, PE headers.
- Dynamic analysis: Is the process of executing malware and analyzing its functionality and behavior. The objective is to understand exactly how and what the malware does during the execution. This is done in a debugger.
- Code Analysis: Is the process of analyzing/reverse engineering assembly code. This can be both statically and dynamically done (Static and dynamic code analysis).
- Behavioral analysis: Is the process of analyzing and monitoring the malware after execution. It involves monitoring the #processes, #registry entries, and #network monitoring to determine the workings of the malware.

# Types of malware
- [[Adware]]
- [[Trojan]]
- [[RAT]]
- [[Ransonware]]
- [[Dropper]]
- [[Virus]]
- [[Worm]]
- [[Spyware]]
- [[Adware]]
- [[Rootkit]]
- [[Keylogger]]

#### Polymorphic Virus [^2]
    - Polymorphic malware only changes part of its code, while the other part remains the same.
    - This feature makes it slightly easier to identify this malware. 
#### Metamorphic Virus [^2]
    - Metamorphic malware completely rewrites every part of its code so that each newly propagated version no longer matches its previous iteration.
