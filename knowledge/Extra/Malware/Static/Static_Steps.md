## Static analysis flow - How we will approach a sample

- Identifying the file type: Target OS, architecture, and format (dll, exe).
- Identifying the malware: Generating a hash of the malware to give it a unique identifier. Using the hash to see if anyone else has analyzed the malware.
- Strings: Strings give us an idea/glimpse of what the malware can do.
- Packing & Obfuscation: Obfuscation & packing are techniques used to prevent detection. Unpacking or deobfuscating can reveal additional information.
- PE headers: The PE header reveals a lot of information on the malware functionality.
