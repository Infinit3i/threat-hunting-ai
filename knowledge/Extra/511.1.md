# GMON

## 511.1.1

GMON (511.1 pg 56) - botnets seem like a demarc between traditional and modern attack techniques




- deny the adversary the ability to achieve their goal
- understand that which is most important to our organization and set up protection of that capability, data and apps

## 511.1.4

### New Security Paradigm
- Detect adversary
- Respond rapidly
- define what you want to achieve or what you want to keep from occurring
- move from detecting to responding quickly

## 511.1.5

### Server Side Exploit
- traditional attacks by adversary adversaries used to attack listening vulnerable services on servers
- 2024 we see way less server exploits compared to client exploits as initial compromise
- 2024 we see way less server exploits compared to client exploits as initial compromise
- older malware was to only spread

- OLD attacks were DDos
- few years ago it was botnets

## 511.1.6
- (prevent > detect) the enemy
- most organisations are (80% prevent controls | 20% detect controls)
- this is a key characteristic of traditional security architecture
- organizations have been overtly focused on the perimeter
- traditional archetecture focuses on filtering based on layer 3 & 4 (TCP/UDP)
- the old way of security was for the security team just to maintain the systems and devices and keep them operational

## 511.1.7
- sguil - support for full packet capture

## 511.1.10
apts will gain access through client side exploitation
 - social engineering
layer 8

old attacks - server
new attacks - client

goals of phishing
 1. click link
 2.  open attachment
email is the most direct way of attack
#### typically  malicious attachments
- pdf
- doc(x)
- rtf
- wmf

### browser headers
- explorer - x64
- chrome - applewebkit/###.##
- edge - trident/#.# 

#Malvertising - injecting malicious code into a known trusted site

### physical compromise is most significant vector of attack
- infected usb
- weaponized usb

### #minnow - phone phishing
weaknesses
- lack of screen real estate
- cant see the real email behind the display name

### Common Client Side attack vectors
- web browsers
- browser extensions
- document-rendering applications
- image rendering applications

#### biggest vulns without exploits
- serving scripts
- active content
	- javascript
	- java
	- activex
	- flash
these are configuration weaknesses not vulnerabilities

97% of enterprise desktops run java
91% of attacks targeted java - kaspersky

#### File format attacks
exploits weakness of app handling file requests


## 511.1.14 advesary informed detection

attacks happen on layer 7 (http, dns, smb, etc.)
understand APTs TTPs

4 ways of persistence
[[registry keys]]
[[startup folder]]
[[scheduled task]]
[[services]]

Security Operations center(SOC)
- outsourcing requires higher operation expense(OPEX) and less capital expense (CAPEX)
- personal team will understand your infastructure better than managed security service provider(MSSP)
### what is a SOC
- detection
- auditing
- response
- operations/maintenance
