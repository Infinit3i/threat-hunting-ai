## Suggested Spray Technique

- A safer approach is to never go faster than one guess per hour (168 per week).
- Generate a short list of passwords to attempt across all users.

- Search policies with PowerShell or Get-FGPP.

- Select one tester to oversee spraying to ensure the clearing of observation windows, especially across multiple tool executions.
