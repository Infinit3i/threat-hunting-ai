### 1. **Authenticode Signing**:
   - Used to sign driver binaries (.sys files) directly.
   - Adds a digital signature to the driver file, verifying its authenticity and integrity.

### 2. **Catalog File Signing**:
   - Involves signing a catalog file (.cat), which contains hash values of the driver files.
   - Ensures the entire driver package (multiple files) is verified, rather than signing individual driver files.
